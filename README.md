A simple an basic implementation for creating and handling well-defined events by providing control about event triggering, subscription, and handling (Typescript included)

## What can be achieved?

With `events` you will be able to design better your classes by specifying well-defined events as members of your `objects` and `prototypes`, it allows you:

- Bring a better modeling from the real world use cases to your software.
- Manage the event triggering in an encapsulated way, which means that if you want (and this is the way it should be) just the `object` or `prototype` that contains the event can trigger it.
- Handle subscription in a better way by the usage of the events signature which will make the events more semantic and better handleable to the subscribers
